# Lab 1 - Garbage Collection And JVM Heap Analysis

Lab focuses on concepts in garbage and how to view the JVM heap.

Personal QUESTIONS:

- Is the heap data structure used for object allocation because things can be sorted easily and searched quickly?
- Are objects sorted by their Object ID in the heap?
- What does reachable storage? (As opposed to available storage).
- Do the "Threads" section in JVisualVM count garbage collection threads too?
- In JVisualVM is the Heap Size the allocated space unused (total)?
